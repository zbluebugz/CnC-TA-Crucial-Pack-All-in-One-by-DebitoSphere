Command & Conquer Tiberium Alliances: Crucial Pack All in One for Firefox and Chrome
Crucial Packs 1-4 have been around for six months and are used by over 2500 players via word of mouth. 
They have been enjoying a steady flow of updates to the scripts to counter script errors using a unique
Update script I designed to help notify the player and keep their script pack up to date.
Traditional All in One user script packs are not customizable so you can not just turn off a script that
you don't find useful until now. Simply install the script and visit the Tiberium Alliances homepage to
access the Crucial Pack Script Settings Window to make a choice of which scripts you would like to use.
All the scripts included in the previous Crucial Packs are activated by default with the TACS simulator 
chosen.
I am not the author of most of the scripts contained within this collection of scripts but I do make sure
everyone knows who contributed to each scripts development by clicking the info button next to the 
check-box for each script in the settings window.

All newly added scripts are disabled by default. Visit the Settings Window to enable all new scripts.
