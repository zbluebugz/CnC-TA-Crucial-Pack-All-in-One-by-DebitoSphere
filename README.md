# Command and Conquer game scripts
(aka CnC.TA.Crucial.Scripts)

Command & Conquer Tiberium Alliances: Crucial Pack All in One by Debitosphere for Firefox and Chrome.

Simply install the script and visit the Tiberium Alliances homepage (https://www.tiberiumalliances.com/home) to access the Crucial Pack Script Settings Window to make a choice of which scripts you would like to use.

I am not the author of the scripts contained within this collection of scripts. Wherever possible, the authors name and source are left in the code. I simply make some tweaks to make some of the scripts work after each of EA game patch/fixes.
