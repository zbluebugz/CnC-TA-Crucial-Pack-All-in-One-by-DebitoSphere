# Command and Conquer game scripts
(aka CnC.TA.Crucial.Scripts)

Command & Conquer Tiberium Alliances: Crucial Pack All in One by Debitosphere for Firefox and Chrome.

Simply install the script and visit the Tiberium Alliances homepage to access the Crucial Pack Script Settings Window to make a choice of which scripts you would like to use.

All the scripts included in the previous Crucial Packs are activated by default with the TACS simulator 
chosen.

I am not the author of most of the scripts contained within this collection of scripts but I do make sure everyone knows who contributed to each scripts development by clicking the info button next to the check-box for each script in the settings window.

All newly added scripts are disabled by default. Visit the Settings Window to enable all new scripts.
